## Getting started

After cloning the repo, you need to navigate to the `app` folder and create `.env` file. In your .env file you need to have following variables: 

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3/

REACT_APP_TOKEN = `please ask for the token`


After that run the following commands from the app directory:

`npm install`

`npm start`

If you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` you should be able to see the app and search for different movies in the app
